Final Year Project using Node.js
--------------------------------

This is my final year project for college, a web application built using Node.js to help students find work-placement/internships.

Since my development is all local at the moment, I am keeping the code version-controlled in a public repository. However, if I decided to publish the website when I'm finished, I'll be upgrading my account and keeping it in a private repository.

For the moment, feel free to use any of the code for your own uses.
